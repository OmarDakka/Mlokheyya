Bookie website<br/>

# Abstract:
**Bookify** was created to bring together those with love for the written word.
It allows users to upload and exchange or sell their own used books.
As a user you can look for your favorite books, and either buy them or trade them with someone else.
You will be able to display your library, update, delete and add new books.

# Main Features:
**The main page** will display all book categories, each category will lead you to a page with a list of all books with the same category. ![logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81506791/120929246-fb918200-c6f0-11eb-9e30-c83965b29682.png)<br/><br/>
**In category page** You can sort books by name, price and filter by book location.![logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81506791/120929240-f3394700-c6f0-11eb-8f68-250cc38d9f43.png)<br/><br/>
If you choose a book, clicking on it will lead you to that **book page**, where you can **view** book details and either:
1. Buy that book (which will transfer the ownership of the book to you).
2. Exchange the book with another book from your list of books (depending on the book's owner preference on which category to exchange the book with).
